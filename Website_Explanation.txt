- generating the terrain

For the terrain, I opted to use a pseudo-Perlin noise, in tandem with spline surface calculations, and other random elements such as creating mountains. While traditional Perlin Noise opts for a very specific set of inputs such as frequency, lacunarity, and octaves, I instead wanted to combine several techniques I know into one system. In doing so, I have managed to create a landscape resembling a series of small islands over the ocean.
